Description:
 The Proxy pattern suggests that you create a new proxy class with the same interface as an original
 service object. Then you update your app so that it passes the proxy object to all of the original
 objectâ€™s clients. Upon receiving a request from a client, the proxy creates a real service object and
 delegates all the work to it.
